Icon for Gamepad Guesser Solution by volkov is marked with CC0 1.0 Universal. To view a copy of this license, visit https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

This icon has couple of famous gamepads in background, which then slightly blurred, and on top of that question mark is placed, symbolizing "Which gamepad is this?" and with love2d logo to show that this is indeed love2d implementation of database.

If you want, you can place this icon somewhere in "Credits" window of your game.

I know, this icon looks kind of... not great, but if someone could draw better, please, open PR with better one.
